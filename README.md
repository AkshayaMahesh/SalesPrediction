# Sales Prediction
👋 Welcome to our forecasting project!

📈 Accurate forecasting is essential for making informed decisions in various fields, including sales prediction.

🛍️ We worked on the Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting Kaggle competition dataset, implemented various methods to forecast store sales, and analyzed their effectiveness.

👨‍💻 Methodology involved performing exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing techniques like interpolation, denoising, and feature engineering such as generating time window difference. We also used XGB, LSTM, and ensemble techniques to improve model efficiency.

📊 Results: Trained 5 machine learning models to predict store sales and used root mean squared error (RMSE) as an evaluation metric to compare model performance. Linear Regression, XGB-LR ensemble, LSTM, and Prophet showed promising results.

🎉 Our project has been successful in accurately forecasting store sales, and we hope to expand our approach to other domains.
